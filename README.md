This Application was developed to be used in conjunction with the inTACT Tactile Sketchpad created by E.A.S.Y. LLC and Wacom Digitizing Technology. The application allows a tactile image that was drawn on the sketchpad surface to be digitally recorded. The user can manipulate the digital image through included editing commands such as toggling line thickness, mirroring the image, or translating the image. The digital image can be saved and downloaded to the users personal computer, where it can then be shared via the internet or sent to the inTACT Printer, which is able to print the digital image in the original tactile format.

Once the driver is downloaded and the inTACT sketchpad is connected to your PC via a USB connection, you should see the device listed in the Wacom Driver software. Once this connection has been established, run the inTACT Sketchpad Application.
